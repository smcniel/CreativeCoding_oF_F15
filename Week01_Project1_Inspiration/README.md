# Project 1 Inspiration

Squids. 


For my first creative coding project I'ld like to create an underwater world of squids.  Iridescent colors against the darkness of the water.  Tenticles that range from long to short, bulbous bodies, and circular patterns.  I have yet to decide if this world consists only of these creatures, or if I will use other organic creatures that also have beautiful reoccurring patterns.

I've included inspirational photos that demonstrate the visuals I plan on creating.
