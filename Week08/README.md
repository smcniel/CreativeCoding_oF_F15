# Week 8 Project 2 In Progress

I've been interested lately in textures and manipulating images and video.  This is a work in progress.

I haven't yet figured out a good way to loop the background. And I haven't added any of the background motion.  I'm hoping to add moving birds (or something?).

Train in action.  (The gif is a little jittery, but that is in the video and not the code.)
